# Mental-Resilience-Analysis-of-Students-using-Machine-Learning

# Descriptions of each python file:
•	Regression & Correlation folder contains python code for finding out correlations and regression results.
•	Outputs folder contains results of different programs generate.
•	ageBinning.py: This code was used for making age categorical using binning.
•	ClusteringResilienceK_1_10.py: This program uses find cluster on resilience score (cluster 2 to 10) 
•	ClusteringResilienceK_Fixed_GenerateLevels.py: This program generates resilience levels based on input value and save two csv files.
•	CrossValidation.py: For classification of 6 classes with SMOTE.
•	featureImportance_Correlation.py: Find the feature importance and correlation saves in CSV file in outputs folder.
•	FindCorrelHeatmap.ipynb: This file should be run in Jupyter Notebook to find the correlation heatmap.
•	hypterparameterTuning.py: This program generates the hyper-parameter tuning results on validation set and test set also. Generates the bar charts of hyper-parameter tuning results.
•	oneHotEncoding.py: Performs one hot encoding on categorical variables. This code was used to encode the categorical variables having more than 2 possible values.

# File Names for different variations of our dataset: (Change the file names in the code to generate different results)
